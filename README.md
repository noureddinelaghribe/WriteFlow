## Architecture

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

WriteFlow follows the **MVVM** architectural pattern to separate concerns and promote organized code structure:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application, including room database entities for history storage and API service interfaces.

- **View:** The user interface components displaying the writing tools and text processing options, consisting of activities and fragments.

- **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling user input processing and preparing data for display. Manages communication with AI APIs and database operations.

This architecture ensures maintainability, testability, and scalability as the application grows and evolves.
